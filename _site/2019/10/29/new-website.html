    <p>Regular visitors to this site will notice it now looks a bit worse than it used to. This is a shame but there’s a good reason for it.</p>

<p>The previous version of this site was costing me money. It was a WordPress site running on a lightly modified version of the <a href="https://wordpress.com/theme/rebalance">Rebalance</a> theme. I loved it, but when I got the hosting bill last month, I had to decide between:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Coughing up £80 for another year (bear in mind this site gets about 2 visitors on a good day)</li>
  <li>Trying to offset the hosting costs with some kind of e-commerce manoeuvre (selling t-shirts etc.)</li>
  <li>Moving the site to cheaper hosting.</li>
  <li>Rebuilding the site with a static site generator and hosting it for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ended up going for number 4, as much as anything because I wanted to see if I could do it. I played around with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and it seems to be working ok… for now…</p>

<p>The pages load quickly and there aren’t any adverts. So that’s all good. I think the theme needs some work. It’s a blogging theme and not really made for showing artwork. But it’ll do for now.</p>

<p>For posterity, here’s a brief history of this site…</p>

<h2 id="2003-angelfire">2003: Angelfire</h2>

<p>This was the first website I ever made. I did it on MS Publisher and hosted it on <a href="http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/">Angelfire</a>. Great days. I love the fact Angelfire is still going.</p>

<h2 id="2006-blogger">2006: Blogger</h2>

<p>This was my first foray into blogging. It was back when a blog was like an online diary: you’d just write about what you’d been doing. I also wrote a few stories and stuff like that. I never found a Blogger theme that worked for displaying images though.</p>

<h2 id="2007-drupal">2007: Drupal</h2>

<p>My older brother set me up with a Drupal site and showed me the how to use FileZilla and PHPMyAdmin to access the backend. I had no idea what I was doing and broke the site a few times. Drupal was tough. It kept telling me to run cron and it was a constant job keeping all the modules up-to-date. Eventually the site got hacked and I decided to start again from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="2010-wordpresscom">2010: WordPress.com</h2>

<p>This was a good experience. I still rate WordPress.com as the best free blogging platform out there.</p>

<h2 id="2012-wordpress-self-hosted">2012: WordPress self-hosted</h2>

<p>About this time I wanted to teach myself how to run my own WordPress site. That way I could tweak it and make it look more how I wanted. I spent ages moving everything across. It used the Illustratr theme, and it looked good. The only problem was that it was too slow. Page loads sometimes took ages.</p>

<h2 id="2014-static-site-with-foundation-5">2014: Static site with Foundation 5</h2>

<p>The slowness of WordPress got me interested in static websites again. <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> was a great way to get into this. The site was bare bones, but this meant it was really fast. I started off using PHP for the header and navigation. Later I moved the site to GitHub Pages, which is free but doesn’t let you use PHP. People usually get around this by using a static site generator like Jekyll or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I figured if I made the site even more minimalist, I could do without this. All the content was images, so I just made the homepage a big list of thumbnails and linked directly to the jpegs. This is rustic, but I still think it’s a good approach for a portfolio site. If someone loads a jpeg, most browsers show this at a fit-to-screen size. With another click, you can zoom in to the full resolution. The only trouble was that I stopped writing on the site. I had a blog for work stuff, but nowhere to write about non-work stuff.</p>

<p>Das ist mein lieblingswebsite. It looked good, it loaded good.</p>

&lt;p&gt;I started trying out brush calligraphy last summer, mostly with felt-tip brush pens. The basic idea is that you go thin on the upstroke and thick on the downstroke. Once you start looking out for it, this type of writing is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I went to a 2 hour lesson by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brahminlettering.com/&quot;&gt;Brahmin Lettering&lt;/a&gt;, and that encouraged me to try brush calligraphy with watercolour paint.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tag" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">scarf no. 2</title><link href="/2020/01/11/scarf-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="scarf no. 2" /><published>2020-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2020/01/11/scarf-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/01/11/scarf-2.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/blog/2020/scarf-2-1200x840.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/2020/scarf-2-1200x840.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scarf no. 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew this back in 2010 for issue 1 of The Comix Reader, a comics anthology edited by the cartoonist Richard Cowdry. We were both living in Brighton at the time. There was a good crowd of cartoonists living there and a vibrant comics scene to go with it. A bunch of us used to self-publish things and put them on sale in Dave’s Comics on Sydney Street. This was all very well but the numbers of comics sold tended to be pretty low. For me, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Cowdry’s idea was to get everyone together, make a low budget anthology on newsprint and do a massive print run. I seem to recall he printed something like 9,000 copies of each issue. Each artist would get a page and you could do what you liked with it. In return for chipping in for the print costs, you’d get a pile of freshly printed newspaper comics to sell. I would sit in the Pavilion Gardens with a pile of them some weekends. People would happily part with £1 for something that was well-made, independent and very reasonably priced. Contributors took the comics to art fairs as well. Someone took a bunch to the Angoulême International Comics Festival, where the comics legend R Crumb was spotted reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard this week that the Comix Reader got a shout out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://averyhillpublishing.com/podcast/signals-from-the-hill-19-scott-jason-smith&quot;&gt;this Avery Hill podcast (about 18mins in)&lt;/a&gt; during an interview with my fellow contributor Scott Jason Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this evening I heard of a band called “The Comet Is Coming”. I wondered for a minute if they’d named themselves after my cartoon. A quick check of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comet_Is_Coming&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; put this idea to rest. Apparently it’s the name of BBC Radiophonic Workshop piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comix Reader ran for about 6 issues in all. It was a good project and took a tonne of work to keep it running and distribute it. To be clear, I played an extremely small part in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard’s out in Berlin these days. You can keep up with his drawings on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/richard_cowdry/&quot;&gt;Instagram page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tag" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">triangle sky on jekyll</title><link href="/2019/10/29/new-website.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="triangle sky on jekyll" /><published>2019-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2019/10/29/new-website</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/10/29/new-website.html">&lt;p&gt;Regular visitors to this site will notice it now looks a bit worse than it used to. This is a shame but there’s a good reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous version of this site was costing me money. It was a WordPress site running on a lightly modified version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/rebalance&quot;&gt;Rebalance&lt;/a&gt; theme. I loved it, but when I got the hosting bill last month, I had to decide between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coughing up £80 for another year (bear in mind this site gets about 2 visitors on a good day)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to offset the hosting costs with some kind of e-commerce manoeuvre (selling t-shirts etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving the site to cheaper hosting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebuilding the site with a static site generator and hosting it for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up going for number 4, as much as anything because I wanted to see if I could do it. I played around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and it seems to be working ok… for now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pages load quickly and there aren’t any adverts. So that’s all good. I think the theme needs some work. It’s a blogging theme and not really made for showing artwork. But it’ll do for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, here’s a brief history of this site…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2003-angelfire&quot;&gt;2003: Angelfire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first website I ever made. I did it on MS Publisher and hosted it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/&quot;&gt;Angelfire&lt;/a&gt;. Great days. I love the fact Angelfire is still going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2006-blogger&quot;&gt;2006: Blogger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first foray into blogging. It was back when a blog was like an online diary: you’d just write about what you’d been doing. I also wrote a few stories and stuff like that. I never found a Blogger theme that worked for displaying images though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2007-drupal&quot;&gt;2007: Drupal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My older brother set me up with a Drupal site and showed me the how to use FileZilla and PHPMyAdmin to access the backend. I had no idea what I was doing and broke the site a few times. Drupal was tough. It kept telling me to run cron and it was a constant job keeping all the modules up-to-date. Eventually the site got hacked and I decided to start again from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2010-wordpresscom&quot;&gt;2010: WordPress.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a good experience. I still rate WordPress.com as the best free blogging platform out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2012-wordpress-self-hosted&quot;&gt;2012: WordPress self-hosted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this time I wanted to teach myself how to run my own WordPress site. That way I could tweak it and make it look more how I wanted. I spent ages moving everything across. It used the Illustratr theme, and it looked good. The only problem was that it was too slow. Page loads sometimes took ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2014-static-site-with-foundation-5&quot;&gt;2014: Static site with Foundation 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slowness of WordPress got me interested in static websites again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.zurb.com/&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; was a great way to get into this. The site was bare bones, but this meant it was really fast. I started off using PHP for the header and navigation. Later I moved the site to GitHub Pages, which is free but doesn’t let you use PHP. People usually get around this by using a static site generator like Jekyll or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I figured if I made the site even more minimalist, I could do without this. All the content was images, so I just made the homepage a big list of thumbnails and linked directly to the jpegs. This is rustic, but I still think it’s a good approach for a portfolio site. If someone loads a jpeg, most browsers show this at a fit-to-screen size. With another click, you can zoom in to the full resolution. The only trouble was that I stopped writing on the site. I had a blog for work stuff, but nowhere to write about non-work stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017-wordpress-self-hosted&quot;&gt;2017: WordPress self-hosted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Das ist mein lieblingswebsite. It looked good, it loaded good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2019-jekyll--github-pages&quot;&gt;2019: Jekyll / GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

I"å<p>With Markdown, it is possible to emphasize words by making them <em>italicized</em>, using <em>astericks</em> or <em>underscores</em>, or making them <strong>bold</strong>, using <strong>double astericks</strong> or <strong>double underscores</strong>. Of course, you can combine those two formats, with both <em><strong>bold and italicized</strong></em> text, using any combination of the above syntax. You can also add a strikethrough to text using a <del>double tilde</del>.</p>

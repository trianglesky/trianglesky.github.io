<p>I drew this in 2005. I was living in south east London at the time, and would have been finishing off my final year of university.</p>

<p>With a diameter of 485mm, this is the biggest mandala Iâ€™ve ever drawn. Iâ€™m not sure how long I spent on it exactly, but it was about four or five months. I drew a pencil grid with rulers and compasses, then filled it in with fineliner pens, working from the centre outwards. Itâ€™s been hung on my wall since then but Iâ€™ve only just now done a proper scan of it (July 2020).</p>

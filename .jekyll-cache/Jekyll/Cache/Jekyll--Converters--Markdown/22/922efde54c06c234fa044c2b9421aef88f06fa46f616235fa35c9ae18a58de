I"Ý<p>Iâ€™d never been to a life drawing session until last month. I blushed, naturally. All part of being British. These are some drawings I did in January at a session calledÂ <a href="http://www.topazpauls.com/reconfigure">Reconfigure</a>, which is a weekly event at Summerhall, Edinburgh. About 60-70 people crowd into the Anatomy Lecture Theatre at what used to be the University of Edinburghâ€™s Vet School. The poses last from 3 to 20 minutes, so you have to be quick.</p>

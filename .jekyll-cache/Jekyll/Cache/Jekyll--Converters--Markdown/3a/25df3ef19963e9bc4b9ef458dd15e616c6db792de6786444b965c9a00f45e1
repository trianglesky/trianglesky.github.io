I"y<p>I got some <a href="https://www.derwentart.com/en/gb/4420/0700802/graphitint-pencils-12-tin">new watercolour pencils</a> and wanted to try them out, so I drew this. It’s a pretty poor likeness of Katherine Mansfield. <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/katherine-mansfield">Original photo is here</a> if you don’t believe me. All the same, I like it.</p>

# The figurines of Asda


17 December 2014

There’s an Asda near us where you can buy a 3D-printed model of yourself. After you’ve grabbed your trolley and have walked past the first set of offers on Coke and Walkers crisps, you see a white tent with glass cabinets outside. In the cabinets are little figurines of real people, each about 15cm high. Some of the figurines are dressed in Asda uniforms, others in weekend casual wear. My wife and I see this tent every time we visit this Asda and often stop to take a look at the figurines. They’re such curious little things.

For my part, I wonder what people do with them once they’ve been made. The Asda website says:

> Imagine what it would be like to have a miniature figurine of yourself or a loved one, a precious moment in time that can be given as *a gift* or as *a reminder of a significant time in your life?*

(Italics mine)

“Happy birthday mate: I got you a little model of myself.”

“Thanks, I’ll… (put it in a box and never talk to you again).”

Or if you prefer, you could keep it for yourself as a memento of the time you went to Asda.

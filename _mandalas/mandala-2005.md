This is the biggest mandala I've ever drawn (485mm diameter). I'm not sure how long I spent on it exactly, but it was about four or five months. I was living in south east London at the time, and would have been finishing off my final year of university.

I drew a pencil grid with rulers and compasses, then filled it in with fineliner pens, working from the centre outwards. It's been hung on my wall since then but I've only just now done a proper scan of it (July 2020).

<p>Edinburgh’s got Muriel Spark fever at the moment. She was born 100 years ago, and there’s an exhibition of letters and manuscripts at the National Library of Scotland. Inspired by the exhibition, I went out and bought <em>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s a sketch of M.S., copied from a <a href="https://www.nls.uk/exhibitions/muriel-spark/new-york">photo</a>.</p>

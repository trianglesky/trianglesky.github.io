<p>I read about Frida Kahlo drawing fruit, so I thought Iâ€™d draw some fruit. I drew the bananas from life, then I made up the background, as if I was on holiday looking at some bananas on a restaurant table. The background makes the bananas look really big. I still have a lot to learn about drawing.</p>

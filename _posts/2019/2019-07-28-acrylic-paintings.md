I did this sometime last year. It's based on the sketches I was doing of people as I sat waiting for buses (hence why everyone has their back turned). It never seemed finished, but it's been unfinished for long enough that the unfinished has become finished. The white background is supposed to be L. S. Lowry-ish.

Acrylic on canvas, 760x505mm.

I did this last week. It started off as an experiment with putting circles on a rule-of-thirds grid, then the circles became celestial bodies.

This is a pencil / watercolour pencil drawing I just did this morning.

I'd never been to a life drawing session until last month. I blushed, naturally. All part of being British. These are some drawings I did in January at a session calledÂ [Reconfigure](http://www.topazpauls.com/reconfigure), which is a weekly event at Summerhall, Edinburgh. About 60-70 people crowd into the Anatomy Lecture Theatre at what used to be the University of Edinburgh's Vet School. The poses last from 3 to 20 minutes, so you have to be quick.

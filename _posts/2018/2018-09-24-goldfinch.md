Copied from [this picture](https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/images/birds-and-wildlife/bird-species-illustrations/goldfinch_adult_1200x675.jpg)

Inspired by [Are These Quirky Comics Launching a New Generation of Bird Enthusiasts?](https://www.audubon.org/news/are-these-quirky-comics-launching-new-generation-bird-enthusiasts)

which gives a nod to Joshua Barkman, creator of the brilliant webcomic [False Knees](http://falseknees.com/).

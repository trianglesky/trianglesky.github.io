These are drawings I've been doing on the bus to work. In this one I was heading into town, so there were lots of people:

In these ones I was heading out to Easter Bush, so fewer people and more road accoutrements (traffic lights, road signs etc):

Drawing on the bus is a good way to pass the time. You notice things you might not otherwise, like the number of people carrying backpacks.

The drawings are shaky and have to be done very quickly. Bus stops; bus moves; subject disappears. Whatever, it's a good exercise.

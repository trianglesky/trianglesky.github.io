Step 1: get pictures of birds via the RSPB's [Find a bird](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/) service (which really should be the name of an internet dating app).

Step 2: make quick copies with dip pen / Indian ink.

Step 3: crudely add watercolour.

The results are hit and miss, but when it works, you get a vaguely Quentin Blake-esque look to the drawings.

Success and failures presented here, featuring Aquatic warbler, Arctic skua, Arctic tern, Avocet, Balearic shearwater, Barnacle goose, Barn owl, Bar-tailed godwit, Bearded tit, Bewick's swan, Bittern, Blackbird, Blackcap, Black grouse, Black guillemot, Black redstart, Black tern, Black-headed gull, Black-necked grebe, Black-tailed godwit, Black-throated diver, Bluethroat, Blue tit, and Brambling.

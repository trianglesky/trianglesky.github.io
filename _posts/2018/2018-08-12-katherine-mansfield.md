I got some [new watercolour pencils](https://www.derwentart.com/en/gb/4420/0700802/graphitint-pencils-12-tin) and wanted to try them out, so I drew this. It's a pretty poor likeness of Katherine Mansfield. [Original photo is here](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/katherine-mansfield) if you don't believe me. All the same, I like it.

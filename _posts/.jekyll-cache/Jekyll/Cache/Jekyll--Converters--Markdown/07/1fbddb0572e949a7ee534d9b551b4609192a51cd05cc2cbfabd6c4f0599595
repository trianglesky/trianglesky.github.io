I"n<p>I did this sometime last year. It’s based on the sketches I was doing of people as I sat waiting for buses (hence why everyone has their back turned). It never seemed finished, but it’s been unfinished for long enough that the unfinished has become finished. The white background is supposed to be L. S. Lowry-ish.</p>

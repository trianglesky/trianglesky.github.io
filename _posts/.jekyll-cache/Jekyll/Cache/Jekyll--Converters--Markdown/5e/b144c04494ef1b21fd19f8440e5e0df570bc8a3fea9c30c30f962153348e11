I"T<p>These are drawings I’ve been doing on the bus to work. In this one I was heading into town, so there were lots of people:</p>

<p>In these ones I was heading out to Easter Bush, so fewer people and more road accoutrements (traffic lights, road signs etc):</p>

<p>Drawing on the bus is a good way to pass the time. You notice things you might not otherwise, like the number of people carrying backpacks.</p>

<p>The drawings are shaky and have to be done very quickly. Bus stops; bus moves; subject disappears. Whatever, it’s a good exercise.</p>

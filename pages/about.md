## previous work

Between 2006 and 2011, I did a webcomic called [Carl Garbanzo](/carl-garbanzo).

I contributed comics to Issues 1, 3 and 4 of the [Comix Reader](http://highlowcomics.blogspot.com/2014/07/brit-comics-comix-reader.html).

In 2012 I did the album cover for [Western Skies, Eastern Dreams](https://xalamproject.bandcamp.com/album/western-skies-eastern-dreams) by Brandon Terzic and Ravi Padmanabha.

I've also made three self-published comics:

-   *Sizemo and Satchmo versus Humanity (2004)*
-   *The Passionate Intensity of Neil Armstrong (2005)*
-   *Tales from the Cosmic Mountain (2005)*
